# Quantium Retail Analytics – Task 2: Trial Layout Assessment

This project replicates Quantium’s Task 2 workflow: testing new chip layouts in trial stores (77, 86, 88) against matched control stores.

## 🔍 Methodology
- Control store selection using correlation + magnitude distance
- Trial period: Feb–Apr 2019
- Metrics: total sales, number of customers
- Uplift testing with t-values and confidence bands

##  Results
- **Store 77** → Significant uplift in March & April →  Roll out
- **Store 86** → Uplift in customers but not sales →  Retest
- **Store 88** → Consistent uplift across trial months →  Roll out

##  Visuals
See `/outputs` for trial vs. control charts with confidence intervals.

##  Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy)
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Recommendation
Roll out the new layout to stores 77 and 88. Retest store 86 before rollout.
